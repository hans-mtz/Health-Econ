Health Insurance and the Demand for Medical Care:
 Evidence from a Randomized Experiment
 By WILLARD G. MANNING, JOSEPH P. NEWHOUSE, NAIHUA DUAN, EMMETT B. KEELER, ARLEEN LEIBOWITZ, AND M. SUSAN MARQUIS*
 
 We estimate how cost sharing, the portion of the bill the patient pays, affects
 the demand for medical services. The data come from a randomized experiment.
 A catastrophic insurance plan reduces expenditures 31 percent relative to zero
 out-of-pocket price. The price elasticity is approximately -0.2. We reject the
 hypothesis that less favorable coverage of outpatient services increases total expenl-
 diture (for example, by deterring preventive care or inducing hospitalization).
 
 Introduction

 Over the past four decades medical care
 costs have grown about 4 percent per year in
 real terms, and the share of GNP devoted to
 medical care has increased from 4.4 percent
 in 1950 to 10.7 percent in 1985 (Daniel
 Waldo, Katherine Levit, and Helen Lazenby,
 1986). A prominent explanation of this rapid
 increase has emphasized the spread of health
 insurance, which has generated demand for
 both a higher quality and an increased quan-
 tity of medical services (Martin Feldstein,
 1971, 1977). In turn, the spread of health
 insurance has been linked to the exemption
 of employer-paid health insurance premiums
 from the individual income tax (Feldstein
 and Elizabeth Allison, 1974; Feldstein and
 Bernard Friedman, 1977; Mark Pauly, 1986).
 Thus, the increase in expenditure is often
 portrayed as a type of market failure in-
 duced by public policy, although such an
 argument is not universally accepted (Morris
 Barer, Robert Evans, and Gregory Stoddart,
 1979; Robert Evans, 1984; John Goddeeris
 and Burton Weisbrod, 1985).
 No one has shown, however, that the
 spread of health insurance can quantitatively
 account for most of the sustained rise in
 health expenditure (Pauly, 1986). If it can-
 not, the widespread presumption that dis-
 torted prices (because of insurance) are in-
 ducing excess resources in medical care is
 not necessarily correct. Central to appraising
 the quantitative role of insurance, of course,
 is the magnitude of the demand response to
 changes in insurance. The literature exhibits
 substantial disagreement, by a factor of 10
 or more, about the price elasticity, or
 coinsurance elasticity, of demand (Richard
 Rosett and Lien Fu Huang, 1973; Karen
 Davis and Louise Russell, 1972; Charles
 Phelps and Newhouse, 1974; Fred Goldman
 and Michael Grossman, 1978; Ann Colle
 and Grossman, 1978; Newhouse and Phelps,
 1974, 1976).1
 Such disagreement is not surprising in light
 of the problems of using nonexperimental
 data to estimate elasticities (Newhouse,
 Phelps, and Marquis, 1980). In cross-sec-
 tional data, insurance is endogenous; those
 who expect to demand more services have a
 clear incentive to obtain more complete in-
 surance, either by selecting a more generous
 option at the place of employment, by work-
 ing for an employer with a generous in-
 surance plan, or by purchasing privately
 more generous coverage.
 Ignoring this selection issue (i.e., treating
 insurance as exogenous) has generally pro-
 duced results showing that demand for
 medical care responds to insurance-induced
 variation in price. Treating insurance as en-
 dogenous, however, has generally led to
 coefficients with confidence intervals that are
 insignificantly different from zero at conven-
 tional levels (Newhouse and Phelps, 1976).2
 That upward bias may be present is sug-
 gested by results from several natural experi-
 ments that compared demands of the same
 individuals before and after their group in-
 surance changed (Anne Scitovsky and Nelda
 Snyder, 1972; Scitovsky and Nelda McCall,
 1977; Phelps and Newhouse, 1972; R. G.
 Beck, 1974). In these cases the change in
 insurance is presumptively exogenous, and
 the elasticity estimates cluster near the low
 end of those cited above. But natural experi-
 ments have no control group, so that any
 other factor that changed over time is per-
 fectly confounded with the insurance change.
 Moreover, the samples available in such
 studies are not necessarily representative of
 the general population, and the changes in
 insurance that could be studied were limited
 to those that occurred in the natural experi-
 ment. Hence, these results too have been
 suspect.3
 In light of the uncertainty about how de-
 mand responds to insurance-induced changes
 in price, and the importance for both public
 and private decisions of quantifying that re-
 sponse, the federal government initiated the
 Rand Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) in
 1974, one aim of which was to narrow uncer-
 tainty about this issue (Newhouse, 1974). In
 this article we report the results of that ex-
 periment. Our findings have implications for
 the role of insurance in explaining the post-
 war increase in medical expenditure, as well
 as for the magnitude of the welfare loss from
 health insurance.
 The HIE had several objectives other than
 improved estimates of how demand re-
 sponds to insurance. Four such objectives
 merit mention here:
 1) Many poor individuals are insured
 through public programs; whether the de-
 mand response differs for the poor is there-
 fore an issue in decisions on the scope of
 these programs.
 2) Insurance need not be uniform across
 various medical services. In fact, second-best
 pricing implies that coverage should be more
 generous for less price elastic (or less in-
 surance elastic) services (Frank Ramsey,
 1927; Richard Zeckhauser, 1970; William
 Baumol and David Bradford, 1970). We
 therefore wished to learn if insurance elas-
 ticities differed for various types of medical
 services. In particular, are demand elas-
 ticities greater for outpatient physician ser-
 vices, psychotherapy, and preventive services,
 which would accord with the observed
 lesser coverage of these services? Other explanations, not mutually exclusive, for the
 lower coverage of these services include greater loading
 charges and asymmetric information between insurer
 and insured.
 3) The public financing of medical care
 has been justified by its status as a merit
 good (Richard Musgrave, 1959) and in par-
 ticular the claim that the consumption of
 medical services leads to improved health,
 which can generate externalities (Cotton
 Lindsay, 1969; Anthony Culyer, 1971, 1976,
 1978; Pauly, 1971; Evans, 1984). Thus, we
 sought to quantify how the change in the
 consumption of medical services at the
 margin might affect health. The answer to
 this question would inform the political de-
 bate about the benefits of public financing of
 medical care services for the indigent and
 would also inform the insurance decisions of
 private agents such as employers and unions.
 4) For the past decade, public policy
 has promoted Health Maintenance Organi-
 zations (HMOs) on the groups that such
 organizations were more efficient in the de-
 livery of services. Almost all evidence of
 lower cost, however, came from uncontrolled
 settings, leaving unresolved the question of
 whether selection of healthier members or
 more efficient treatment was responsible for
 lower costs in HMOs (Harold Luft, 1981).
 Also unresolved was the question of whether
 any true reduction in services at HMOs might
 adversely affect health status. Therefore, we
 sought to decompose the observed lower use
 of services at one HMO into the pure effect
 of the HMO, on the one hand, and treating a
 possibly less sickly group of enrollees on the
 other. Moreover, we sought to determine
 whether any reduced use of services affected
 health status and satisfaction.
 This article considers the first two ques-
 tions in some detail and summarizes the
 findings on the latter two.

 I. Data and Sample
 A. The Design of the Rand Health
 Insurance Experiment5

 Between November 1974 and February
 1977, the HIE enrolled families in six sites:
 Dayton, Ohio; Seattle, Washington; Fitch-
 burg, Massachusetts; Franklin County, Mas-
 sachusetts; Charleston, South Carolina; and
 Georgetown County, South Carolina. The sites were selected to represent the four census
 regions; to represent the range of city sizes (a proxy for
 the complexity of the medical delivery system); to cover
 a range of waiting times to appointment and physician
 per capita ratios (to test for the sensitivity of demand
 elasticities to nonprice rationing); and to include both
 urban and rural sites in the North and the South.
 Families participating in the experiment
 were assigned to one of 14 different fee-for-
 service insurance plans or to a prepaid group
 practice; additionally, some members al-
 ready enrolled in the prepaid group practice
 were enrolled as a separate group. The fee-
 for-service insurance plans, the main fo-
 cus of this article, had different levels of
 cost sharing, which varied over two dimen-
 sions: the coinsurance rate (percentage paid
 out-of-pocket) and an upper limit on an-
 nual out-of-pocket expenses. The coinsurance
 rates were 0, 25, 50, or 95 percent. Each plan
 had an upper limit (the Maximum Dollar
 Expenditure or MDE) on annual out-of-
 pocket expenses of 5, 10, or 15 percent of
 family income, up to a maximum of $1,000.7
 Beyond the MDE, the insurance plan reim-
 bursed all covered expenses in full.
 Covered expenses included virtually all
 medical services.8 One plan had different
 coinsurance rates for inpatient and ambula-
 tory medical services (25 percent) than for
 dental and ambulatory mental health services
 (50 percent). And on one plan, the families
 faced a 95 percent coinsurance rate for out-
 patient services, subject to a $150 annual
 limit on out-of-pocket expenses per person
 ($450 per family). In this plan, all inpatient
 services were free; in effect, this plan had
 approximately an outpatient individual de-
 ductible.9

 
 7 The maximum was $750 in some site-years for the
 25 percent coinsurance plans. The $1000 was kept fixed
 in nominal dollars from 1974 to 1981. During this time
 the medical care component of the CPI rose by 96
 percent.
 8 See Lorraine Clasquin (1973) for a discussion of the
 rationale for the HIE structure of benefits. Nonpreven-
 tive orthodontia and cosmetic surgery (related to pre-
 existing conditions) were not covered. Also excluded
 were outpatient psychotherapy services in excess of 52
 visits per year per person. In the case of each exclusion,
 it is questionable whether anything could have been
 learned about steady-state demand during the 3- to
 5-year lifetime of the experiment.
 9 The coinsurance rate for the 95 percent and individual 
 deductible plans was actually 100 percent in the first
 year of Dayton, the first site. The rate was changed to
 95 percent for all other site-years of the experiment, in
 order to increase the incentive to file claims, although
 there was no statistical evidence at that time of under-
 filing. Subsequent analysis has shown that the mean
 outpatient physician expenditure on the 95 percent
 coinsurance plans relative to the free-care plan is under-
 stated by about 5 to 10 percent because of a lower
 propensity to file claims (William Rogers and New-
 house, 1985).


 Families were assigned to these insurance
 plans using the Finite Selection Model (Carl
 Morris, 1979). This model was used to
 achieve as much balance across plans as
 possible while retaining randomization; that
 is, it minimizes the correlation between the
 experimental treatments and health, demo-
 graphic, and economic covariates.
 To study methods effects, the HIE em-
 ployed four randomized subexperiments
 (Newhouse et al., 1979). We describe two
 here. To test for transitory demand effects
 (Charles Metcalf, 1973; Kenneth Arrow,
 1975), 70 percent of the households were
 enrolled for three years; the remainder for
 five years. Also, to ensure that no one was
 worse off financially from participating in
 the study, families were paid a lump sum
 payment.10 To test for a possible stimulus to
 utilization, 40 percent of the families were
 given an unanticipated increase in their lump
 sum payment during the next to the last year
 of the study.

 B. The Sample

 The enrolled sample is for the most part a
 random sample of each site's nonaged popu-
 lation, but some groups were not eligible.1'
 Table 1 gives the sample by plan and site; it
 excludes the 1,982 persons in the HMO ex-
 periment. Note that plans are not perfectly
 balanced by site; in particular, no one was
 enrolled in the 50 percent plan in Seattle,
 and about half of those in the 50 percent
 plan are in Dayton, whereas only 20 percent
 of all participants are in Dayton.12
 1. Dependent Variables. In the interest of
 brevity, we focus primarily on the use of
 medical services other than outpatient psy-
 chotherapy and dental services."3 We do,
 however, summarize results for dental ser-
 vices below.

 10 Because of size of the lump sum payment, there is
 a theoretical presumption of no bias from refusal or
 attrition. Although refusal and attrition occurred at
 higher rates on higher coinsurance plans, refusal and
 attrition appear to have been random within plan. More
 precisely, we detect no differences by plan at enrollment
 in pre-experimental use or health status, nor do we
 detect differences in the rate of spending between those
 who withdrew from the experiment and those who did
 not. More detailed data on issues of refusal and attri-
 tion can be found in Brook et al. (1983, 1984); Kevin
 O'Grady et al. (1985); Newhouse et al. (1987). The de-
 tails of the lump sum payment rules can be found in
 Clasquin and Marie Brown (1977).
 11 The ineligible groups include: 1) those 62 years of
 age and older at the time of enrollment; 2) those with
 incomes in excess of $25,000 in 1973 dollars or $58,000
 in 1984 dollars); this excluded 3 percent of the families
 contacted; 3) those eligible for the Medicare disability
 program, 4) those in jails or institutionalized for indefi-
 nite periods; 5) those in the military or their depen-
 dents; and 6) veterans with service-connected disabili-
 ties.
 12 About 3 percent of the actual participant-years are
 truncated because the participant withdrew partway
 through an accounting year. With the exception of
 deaths, we do not use such participants in the estima-
 tion sample because the 4-part model (see below)
 requires equal time periods for each observation. If a
 person is only observed for one quarter and the
 expenditure distribution is lognormal, the annual distri-
 bution is not simply the quarterly distribution scaled up
 by a factor of 4; i.e., the lognormal distribution does
 not convolute. The sample used in this analysis more
 specifically includes enrollees during each full year that
 they participated, and the last accounting year in the
 study for those who died. We excluded data on partial
 years of participation by newborns. (Their expenses in
 the hospital at the time of birth, however, are attributed
 to the mother.) We tested the legitimacy of excluding
 those with partial years by comparing expenditure rates
 of part-year persons, adjusted for time at risk, with
 what they would have spent if they behaved like full-year
 people. Specifically we regressed actual expenditure
 minus (time at risk times the 4-part model prediction)
 on plan dummy variables. We could not reject the null
 hypothesis of no difference by plan (x2(4) = 2.67, p >
 .50). The estimated effect of including part-year par-
 ticipants is to negligibly increase the estimated response
 to plan.
 13 See Manning et al. (1984b, 1986b) and Kenneth
 Wells et al. (1982) for additional results on the use of
 mental health care, and Manning et al. (1985) for ad-
 ditional results on dental use. Mental health care use is
 on the order of 4 percent of the expenditures discussed
 here.

 2. Independent Variables. Although we pre-
 sent sample means by plan, we also present
 results controlling for site, health status, so-
 ciodemographic, and economic variables.
 Insurance Plan Variables. Rather than
 impose a functional form, we have conserva-
 tively used dummy variables for insurance
 plans. We have grouped the insurance plans
 into five groups: 1) the free plan (no out-
 of-pocket cost to the family); 2) 25 percent
 coinsurance rate plans for medical services;
 3) 50 percent coinsurance rate plans for
 medical services; 4) 95 percent coinsurance
 rate plans for medical services; and 5) the
 plan with a 95 percent coinsurance rate for
 outpatient services (subject to a limit of $150
 per person or $450 per family per year) and
 free inpatient care.14 The middle three groups
 we call the family-pay plans.
 Other Covariates. In addition to dummy
 variables for each plan group, we also in-
 cluded covariates for age, sex, race, family
 income, health status, family size, and site
 (Manning et al., 1987). With the exception of
 family size and income, the data were col-
 lected before or at enrollment in the study.
 The value for family size varies by year.
 Family income data are from 1975 in Day-
 ton, 1978 for the three-year group in South
 Carolina, and 1976 for all other partic-
 ipants."5 Health status measures are described
 more fully in Brook et al. (1983, 1984),
 R. Burciaga Valdez et al. (1985), and Valdez
 (1986).
 Although we have not tested for all possi-
 ble interactions among covariates, we did
 examine some that are important for policy
 purposes (for example, income and plan). As
 a result, we have included interactions be-
 tween being a child and plan in the inpatient
 and outpatient use equations (see below),
 between plan and income in the probabilities
 of any use of medical and of any inpatient
 use (see below), and between sex and age in
 all equations. The remaining interactions
 were neither significant nor appreciable, and
 have been omitted.
 
 14 Differences among plans with 5, 10, and 15 percent
 upper limits are too small to detect at the level of
 annual expenditure. Hence, we have pooled across these
 different expenditure ceilings. See Keeler et al. (1987)
 for further discussion of how a varying ceiling affects
 demand.
 15 The first year of participation was 1975 for the
 Dayton participants; the South Carolina 3-year group
 began participation in late 1978 (about a quarter par-
 ticipated for two months and another quarter for one
 month of 1978); and the remainder of the sample
 enrolled in 1976 or early 1977. Most of the enrollment
 was in the latter half of 1976. We used these data
 because we believed the income measure was more
 reliable than the data on pre-experimental income. The
 data we used were collected on forms keyed to income
 tax returns, whereas data on pre-experimental income
 were responses to a personal interview.

 C. Unit of Analysis

 The unit of analysis is a person-year. We
 use the year as the time frame for ease of
 interpretation and because the upper limit
 on out-of-pocket expenses is an annual limit.
 We use the person as the unit of observation
 because most major determinants of the use
 of services are individual (for example, age,
 sex, and health status) rather than family
 (for example, insurance coverage, and family
 income).


 II. Statistical Methods

 We estimated two types of models. In
 addition to simple means (ANOVA), we pre-
 sent more robust estimates based on a four-
 equation model developed by Duan et al.
 (1982 and 1983). This model gains over
 ANOVA (and ANOCOVA) by exploiting
 three characteristics of the distribution of
 medical expenses. First, a large proportion
 of the participants use no medical services
 during the year. Second, the distribution of
 expenses among users is highly skewed.
 Third, the distribution of medical expenses
 is different for individuals with only outpa-
 tient use than for individuals with inpatient
 use.
 Because of these three characteristics,
 ANOVA (and ANOCOVA) yields imprecise,
 though consistent, estimates of the effects of
 health insurance, health status, and socioeco-
 nomic status on the use of medical services,
 even for a sample size on the order of 20,000
 (not all independent) observations. As Duan
 et al. (1982 and 1983) and Manning et al.
 (1987) show, a four-equation model that ex-
 ploits the characteristics of the medical ex-
 pense distribution yields consistent estimates
 with lower mean square error than ANOVA.
 
 A. The Four-Equation Model

 We partition the participants into three
 groups: nonusers, users of only outpatient
 services, and users of any inpatient services.
 We examine the expenses of the last two
 groups of users separately.
 The first equation of the model is a probit
 equation for the probability that a person
 will receive any medical service during the
 year-from either inpatient or outpatient
 sources. Thus, this equation separates users
 from nonusers, and addresses the first char-
 acteristic described above, a large proportion
 of the population does not use medical
 services during the year. The second equa-
 tion is a probit equation for the conditional
 probability that a user will have at least one
 inpatient stay, given that he has some medical
 use. This equation separates the two user
 groups, and thus addresses the third char-
 acteristic noted above, different distributions
 of medical expenses for inpatient and outpa-
 tient users.
 The third equation is a linear regression
 for the logarithm of total annual medical
 expenses of the outpatient-only users. The
 fourth equation is a linear regression for the
 logarithm of total annual medical expenses
 for the users of any inpatient service. This
 last equation includes both outpatient and
 inpatient expenses for users of any inpatient
 services. Grouping expenses by person rather than the more
 natural all-inpatient and all-outpatient expenditure
 eliminates the need to account for across-equation cor-
 relation in calculating standard errors of total expendi-
 ture.
 The logarithmic transformation of annual
 expenses practically eliminates the undesir-
 able skewness in the distribution of expenses
 among users, the second characteristic noted
 above. In particular, the logarithmic trans-
 form yields nearly symmetric and roughly
 normal error distributions. Further details
 are available in Duan et al. (1982 and 1983)
 and Manning et al. (1987).
 While our use of the four-equation model
 is motivated by our desire to have the sto-
 chastic term approximate the normal as-
 sumption as closely as possible (to obtain
 robust estimates), the error distributions for
 the two levels of expense equations still de-
 viate from the normal assumption. As a re-
 sult, if we were to use the normal theory
 retransformation from the logarithmic scale
 to the raw dollar scale $(\exp(\sigma^2/2))$, the pre-
 dictions would be inconsistent. Instead we
 use a nonparametric estimate of the retrans-
 formation factors, the smearing estimate,
 developed by Duan (1983), which in this
 application is the sample average of the ex-
 ponentiated least squares residuals:
 (1) $\hat \phi_j=\Sum exp(\hat e_{ij})/n_j, j = 3,4,$
 where $n_j$ = sample size for equation $j$,
 $\varepsilon_{ij} = ln(y_{ij}) -x_{ij}\hat \beta_j$,
 $\hat\beta_j =$ OLS estimate of $\beta_j$,
 and $i$ indexes the person. The smearing
 estimate is weakly consistent (asymptotically
 unbiased) for the retransformation factor if
 the error distribution does not depend on
 the characteristics $x_i$.17
 A consistent estimate of the expected
 medical expense for person i based on the
 four-equation model is given by
 (2) $E (Medical Expenditure_i)$
 $= \hat p_i [( 1-\hat \pi )exp( x_i\hat\beta_3)\hat\phi_3 +\hat\pi\exp(x_i\hat\beta_4)\hat\phi_4]$
 where $\hat p_i= \Phi(x_i,\hat\beta_1)$
 =estimated probability of any
 medical use,
 $\hat\pi_i = \Phi(x_i\hat\beta_2)=$ estimated conditional prob-
 ability for a medical user to
 have any inpatient use,
 $\exp(x_i\hat\beta_3)\hat\phi_3=$ estimate of the conditional
 expense for medical services
 if outpatient only,
 $exp(x_i\hat\beta_4)\hat\phi_4=$ estimate of the conditional  
 expense for medical services
 if any inpatient,
 $\hat\phi_3, \hat\phi_4=$ estimated retransformation ("smear-
 ing") factors of the error terms for
 level of outpatient only and any in-
 patient expenditure equations.
 Our estimates of predicted expenditure
 presented below are based on equation (2).
 We use equation (2) to predict medical ex-
 penditure for each person we enrolled, alter-
 natively placing that person on each plan (by
 successively turning on plan dummy vari-
 ables). We then average within plans over
 each predicted value to obtain a mean value
 for each plan. Standard errors of the pre-
 dicted values are obtained by the delta
 method (see Duan et al., 1983, pp. 40, 48).
 The regression equations underlying our pre-
 dicted values are presented in Manning et al.
 (1987).

 B. Correlation in the Error Terms

 Although we have over 20,000 observa-
 tions, we do not have the same number of
 independent observations, because of sub-
 stantial positive correlations in the error
 terms among family members and over time
 among observations on the same person.
 These correlations exist in all four equations.
 Failure to account for them in the analysis
 would yield inefficient estimates of the coeffi-
 cients and inconsistent estimates of the
 standard errors. In the results presented be-
 low we have corrected the inference statistics
 (t, F, and x2) for this positive correlation
 using a nonparametric approach.'8

 C. Selection Modes

 The econometric literature provides an ad-
 ditional class of models for continuous but
 limited dependent variables such as medical
 expenditure. These models include the Tobit
 model (James Tobin, 1958), the Adjusted
 Tobit model (Wynand van de Ven and
 Bernard van Praag, 1981a, b), and sample
 selection models (G. S. Maddala, 1983). Like
 our four-equation model, these are multi-
 equation models, with an equation (often a
 probit) for whether there is a positive
 amount, and another equation for the level
 of the positive amount. These models differ
 from ours in that they explicitly model the
 correlation between the probability of any
 use and the level of use. Although they may
 appear to be more general, in fact for this
 problem they are not (Duan et al., 1984). In
 particular, the four-equation model just de-
 scribed is not nested within the sample selec-
 tion model. Manning et al. (1987) provides a
 fuller discussion of these models and, using a
 split-sample validation, show that the four-
 equation model has significantly less bias
 than the sample selection model and is sta-
 tistically indistinguishable on the basis of
 mean square error.19 In a separate Monte
 Carlo study, Manning, Duan, and William
 Rogers (forthcoming) show that models such
 as the four-equation model can be more
 robust, and are no worse than selection mod-
 els when the data are truly generated by a
 selection model.
 
 17 Moreover, when the normal assumption does hold,
 the smearing factor has high efficiency (90 percent or
 more) relative to the normal retransformation for a wide
 range of parameter values, including those in this analy-
 sis (see Duan, 1983, Section 5; and F. Mehran, 1973). In
 the results presented below, the smearing factors for the
 log level of expense for outpatient only users are esti-
 mated separately by plan and year to allow for hetero-
 scedasticity. For the log level of expenses for users of
 any inpatient services, the smearing factor is a constant.
 See Duan et al. (1983) and Appendix C of Manning
 et al. (1987) for a comparison of normal theory and
 nonparametric retransformations.
 18 The correction is similar to that for the random
 effects least squares model, or equivalently the intraclus-
 ter correlation model (S. R. Searle, 1971). The model is
 described in Brook et al. (1984), based on prior work by
 P. J. Huber (1967) on the variance of a robust regres-
 sion.
 19 The bias in the selection models in the forecast
 sample was appreciable, on the order of 10-25 percent
 of the mean in the two replications we made (p <.10).
 In contrast, the bias for the 4-part model was 2 percent
 (t =.50).


 III. Empirical Results
 A. Main Effects of Insurance Plan:
 ANOVA Estimates
 
 The data from the Health Insurance Ex-
 periment (HIE) clearly show that the use of
 medical services responds to changes in the
 amount paid out-of-pocket. Table 2 provides
 the sample means and standard errors by
 plan for several measures of use of services
 -the probability of being treated, visit and
 admission rates, and total expenses. The per
 capita expenses on the free plan (no out-of-
 pocket costs) are 45 percent higher than
 those on the plan with a 95 percent
 coinsurance rate, subject to an upper limit
 on out-of-pocket expenses. Spending rates
 on plans with an intermediate level of cost
 sharing lie between these two extremes. The
 right-most column shows that adjusting for
 the site imbalance in plan assignments (see
 Table 1) makes little difference.
 Cost sharing affects primarily the number
 of medical contacts, rather than the intensity
 of each of those contacts. In other words, the
 differences in expenditures across plans re-
 flect real variation in the number of contacts
 rather than an increase in the intensity or
 charge per service.20 For example, outpa-
 tient expenses on the free plan are 67 per-
 cent higher than those on the 95 percent
 plan, while outpatient visit rates are 66 per-
 cent higher.
 The largest decreases in the use of outpa-
 tient services occurs between the free and 25
 percent plans, with smaller but statistically
 significant differences between the 25 per-
 cent and other family coinsurance (pay) plans
 $(\Chi^2(2) = 9.48, p <.01)$.
 There are no significant differences among
 the family coinsurance (25, 50, and 95 per-
 cent) plans in the use of inpatient services.
 For the probability of any inpatient use,
 total admission rates, and inpatient ex-
 penses, the contrasts between the 25, 50, and
 95 percent plans have p values greater than
 0.50. As noted above, this lack of a signifi-
 cant difference is probably due to the effect
 of the upper limit on out-of-pocket expenses.
 Seventy percent of people with inpatient care
 exceeded their upper limit. Hence, the out-
 of-pocket cost of a hospitalization was at
 most $1000 (in current dollars), and did not
 vary much among the pay plans (other than
 the individual deductible).21

 The Individual Deductible plan exhibits a
 somewhat different pattern from the other
 cost sharing plans. Recall that this plan has
 free inpatient care, but a 95 percent coin-
 surance rate (up to a $150 per person, or
 $450 per family annual maximum) for out-
 patient services. Total expenditures on this
 plan are significantly less than the free plan
 (t = - 2.34, p <.02). This overall response is
 the sum of a one-third reduction in outpa-
 tient expenses (t=- 6.67), and a less than
 one-tenth reduction in inpatient expenses
 (t = -0.68). Thus, this plan looks like a
 combination of the 50 or 95 percent plans
 for outpatient care and the free of 25 percent
 plan for inpatient care. The admission rate
 for the Individual Deductible plan lies
 roughly midway between the free plan and
 family coinsurance plan rates, suggesting a
 nontrivial cross-price elasticity between in-
 patient and outpatient services.

 B. Main Effects of Insurance Plan:
 Four-Equation Estimates

 Because sample means are quite sensitive
 to the presence of catastrophic cases, we
 used the four-equation model to provide
 more robust estimates of the plan re-
 sponses.22 The use of covariates in these
 equations further enhances precision and re-
 moves the relatively minor imbalances across
 plan, including the site imbalance. Table 3
 presents estimates from this model of plan
 response for the probability of any use of
 medical services, the unconditional probabil-
 ity of any inpatient use, and total medical
 expenses. Figure 1 displays the expenditure
 results.
 Mean predicted expenditure in the free
 care plan is 46 percent higher than in the 95
 percent plan (p <.001), almost exactly the
 difference found in the sample means.23 Like
 the sample means, these more robust esti-
 mates also indicate that the largest response
 to plan occurs between free care and the
 25 percent plan, with smaller decreases
 thereafter.
 Not surprisingly, given the approximate
 orthogonality of plan and covariates, adding
 covariates does not change the estimated
 probability of any use of medical services-
 87 percent of the free plan participants are
 predicted to use any service during the course
 of the year, while only 68 percent of the
 95 percent plan participants are. These dif-
 ferences in the likelihood of receiving any
 care account for over three-fifths of the over-
 all response to cost sharing. Virtually all the
 remaining response is attributable to the
 effect of cost sharing on hospital admissions.
 Cost sharing for outpatient services only
 (the individual deductible plan) produces a
 different pattern of utilization than cost
 sharing for all services. Outpatient-only cost
 sharing reduces total expenditures relative to
 free care (p <.0001), largely by reducing the
 likelihood of any use (p <.0001). Outpa-
 tient-only cost sharing also reduces inpatient
 use, but by an insignificant amount (p =.20
 for the probability of any inpatient use).
 This last result is the only important change
 from the previously published analysis of the
 first 40 percent of the data (Newhouse et al.,
 1981). In that analysis, inpatient use was less
 on the deductible plan, and one could reject
 at the 5 percent level the hypothesis that the
 free plan and individual deductible plan
 means for inpatient use were the same. This
 difference may have occurred because infla-
 tion in the late 1970's reduced the real value
 of the deductible, which was kept fixed at
 $150 (i.e., in nominal dollars), or may have
 simply been due to chance.

 C. Use by Subgroups

 An important goal of the HIE was to
 study how the response to cost sharing varied
 across subgroups. These included differences
 in responses across income groups, dif-
 ferences between adults and children, dif-
 ferences between the sickly and healthy, as
 well as differences across time (for example,
 any transitory surges in use as insurance
 changed), and differences across medical
 markets (for example, urban vs. rural).
 1. Across Income Groups. Different aspects
 of the use of medical services exhibit differ-
 ent responses to income (Table 4).24 In Ta-
 ble 4 we observe differences in use that are
 due to both income directly and the effects
 of variables correlated with income; that is,
 these are not partial effects.
 Within each of the five plans the probabil-
 ity of any use of medical services increases
 with income, with larger increases for the
 family pay (25, 50, and 95 percent) and
 individual deductible plans than the free
 plan. 25 In contrast, the (unconditional) prob-
 ability of any use of inpatient services de-
 clines with income for the family pay plans,
 but is not significantly different across in-
 come groups for the two plans with free
 inpatient care (the free and individual de-
 ductible plans). Because of these two con-
 flicting effects of income-positive on outpa-
 tient use but negative on inpatient use-the
 net result on total expenditure is a shallow
 U-shaped response.
 Our estimate of the differences by income
 group within the family-pay plans is in-
 fluenced by the income-related upper limit in
 out-of-pocket expenses. The observed re-
 sponse in a combination of the direct re-
 sponse to income, and the fact that families
 with lower incomes are more likely to exceed
 their (lower) limit and receive free care for
 part of the year.26 If medical care is a nor-
 mal good, then any positive direct effect of
 greater income would be reduced by the
 decreased likelihood of going over the limit.
 In the case of the positive effect of income
 on the probability of any use, the direct
 income effect is probably more important,
 and in the case of the negative effect on the
 probability of any inpatient use, the limit
 has relatively more influence.27
 The Individual Deductible plan provides a
 cleaner test of the differences by income
 group of use of medical services, because the
 deductible in that plan is not income related.
 We observe an insignificant 10 percent in-
 crease in medical expenses between the bot-
 tom and top third of the income distribu-
 tion. The effect of income is limited to an
 increased likelihood of using outpatient
 services, probably because inpatient services
 are free on this plan.
 Thus far we have compared response
 among income groups rather than examining
 the partial effect of income. Although in-
 come has a statistically significant positive
 partial effect on use of service, the magni-
 tude is small enough to be swamped by
 other factors correlated with income (for de-
 tails see Manning et al., 1987, Appendix A,
 Tables 2-4 and 6).28

 2. Across Age Groups. We found about the
 same outpatient response to insurance plans
 for children (ages less than 18) as for adults,
 but children are less plan responsive for
 inpatient care (Table 5).29 As we observed
 with a subset of these data (see Newhouse
 et al., 1981 and 1982; Leibowitz et al., 1985),
 we cannot reject the hypothesis that admis-
 sion rates for children show no response to
 insurance coverage.30 By contrast, adults
have significantly lower use of inpatient
 services on the family-pay plans than they
 do on the free plan.3' For outpatient
 services, we observe a very similar pattern of
 plan responses for children and adults.

 D. Other Subgroups

 1. Health Status. Although health status was
 a strong predictor of expenditure levels, we
 observed no differential response to health
 insurance coverage between the healthy and
 the sickly (Manning et al., 1987). This null
 result is striking because of the upper limit
 feature. If anything, the presence of an up-
 per limit on out-of-pocket expenses would
 lead to less plan response for the sickly; all
 other things equal, sicker individuals are
 more likely to exceed their upper limit and
 receive some free care-especially on the 95
 percent plan, where care is free after gross
 expenditures of $1050 or more. Furthermore,
 some might expect the sickly to be less re-
 sponsive to insurance coverage than the
 healthy, on the supposition that their use of
 services is less discretionary. If, in fact, there
 is no interaction between plan and health
 status, one can infer that the opposite is true
 at the margin; that is, at the margin the
 sickly exhibit more discretion.

 2. Sites. The six sites in the HIE were selected
 to reflect a spectrum of city sizes, waiting
 times to appointment, and physician to
 population ratios (Newhouse, 1974).32 Our
 concern was that the response to insurance
 coverage could vary according to the com-
 plexity of the medical market or to the ex-
 cess demand in the medical delivery system.
 Yet we found no differences among the sites
 in the response to insurance coverage,
 12(19)=14.96 (p>.50). The uniformity of
 response across the sites gives some reason
 to believe the results may be representative
 of the United States, and we have so used
 them below.
 Interestingly, the site with the longest de-
 lay to appointment and lowest physician to
 population ratio (Fitchburg) had the second
 highest probability of any use, the second
 highest expenditures per enrollee, and the
 highest probability of any inpatient use. The
 latter two phenomena may represent sub-
 stitution of inpatient for outpatient care
 (Jeffrey McCombs, 1984), and the first may
 indicate that the presence of emergency
 rooms removes the constraint of the queue
 (Stephen Long, Russell Settle, and Bruce
 Stuart, 1986).33

 2. Period of Enrollment. As noted above, we
 enrolled families for three or five years to see
 if the response to insurance changed over
 time and if the duration of enrollment
 mattered. The free plan might generate tran-
 sitorily high demand; the 95 percent plan
 might generate postponement of demand at
 the end of the experiment (Arrow, 1975;
 Metcalf, 1973). Neither effect was found; see
 Manning et al. (1987) for further details.34
 Nor did duration of enrollment matter to
 either the absolute level of spending or the
 responsiveness to plan.
 3. Subexperiments. As described above, the
 Health Insurance Experiment contained a
 number of subexperiments to study methods
 effects. None of the subexperiments had a
 measurable effect on expenditure (Manning
 et al., 1987).

 E. Dental Results

 These results are reported in greater detail
 elsewhere (Manning et al., 1985, 1986a). Den-
 tal services do show greater responsiveness
 to plan in Year 1 than in subsequent years
 (p <.001) (Table 6). This would be expected
 if dental services were more durable than
 other medical services, as is plausible. The
 responsiveness of demand by plan in Year 2,
 which is typical of the middle years, is of the
 same general magnitude as that for other
 medical services.

 F. Health Status Outcome Results

 These results also are reported in greater
 detail elsewhere (Brook et al., 1983, 1984;
 Valdez et al.; Valdez; Howard Bailit et al.,
 1985). For the person with mean characteris-
 tics, we can rule out clinically significant
 benefits from the additional services in the
 free fee-for-service plan relative to either the
 cost-sharing plans or the HMO experimental
 group. For poor adults (the lowest 20 per-
 cent of the income distribution) who began
 the experiment with high blood pressure
 (specifically, who were in the upper 20
 percent of the diastolic blood pressure distri-
 bution) there was a clinically significant re-
 duction in blood pressure in the free fee-
 for-service plan compared to the plans with
 cost sharing. Epidemiologic data imply that
 the magnitude of this reduction would lower
 mortality about 10 percent each year among
 this group, about 6 percent of the popula-
 tion. (The sample size is much too small to
 test this prediction with actual mortality
 among the experimental population.) For
 poor adults who began the experiment with
 vision problems that were correctable with
 eyeglasses, there was a modest improvement
 in corrected vision. Individuals on the free
 care plan between the ages of 12 and 35
 showed a modest improvement in the health
 of the gums; caries (decayed teeth) were also
 more likely to be filled on the free care plan.
 The specific gains in health just described,
 for high blood pressure, myopia, and dental
 care, were all for relatively prevalent chronic
 problems (of course, we had difficulty detect-
 ing effects for rare problems) that are rela-
 tively inexpensive to diagnose and remedy.
 One can infer that programs targeted at these
 problems would be much more cost effective
 in achieving these gains in health than free
 care for all services. For example, more than
 half the benefit of free care for high blood
 pressure (and presumably for risk of dying)
 was available from a one-time screening ex-
 amination, whose cost is a small fraction of
 free care for all services (Keeler et al., 1985).
 G. Health Maintenance Organization Results
 We also randomized a group of par-
 ticipants into an HMO, the Group Health
 Cooperative of Puget Sound in Seattle.35 This
 group, whom we call the HMO Experimen-
 tals, was given a plan of benefits identical to
 the free fee-for-service (FFS) plan. In ad-
 dition, we enrolled a random sample of ex-
 isting HMO enrollees, the HMO Controls.
 Thus, a comparison of the experimentals and
 the free fee-for-service plan establishes the
 "pure" HMO effect on use; a comparison of
 the experimentals and controls establishes
 the extent, if any, of selection with respect to
 the HMO.36
 Our results (Table 7) show no evidence of
 selection in the single HMO that we studied;
 those previously enrolled at the HMO (the
 Controls) used services at approximately the
 same rate as those who were not previously
 enrolled (the Experimentals). By contrast,
 the percentage of Experimental plan par-
 ticipants with one or more hospital admis-
 sions was only two-thirds as great as the
 percentage on the free fee-for-service plan.
 Because outpatient use was approximately
 similar on the two plans, the expenditure
 difference between the HMO Experimentals
 and free fee-for-service participants was
 somewhat narrower; expenditures per person
 among the HMO Experimentals were only
 72 percent of expenditures on the free fee-
 for-service plan.
 These findings demonstrate that a mark-
 edly less hospital-intensive style of medicine
 than is commonly practiced in the fee-
 for-service system is technically feasible.
 Whether the technical style will be attractive
 to consumers, and, if it is, whether a market
 of competing HMOs is economically feasible
 -or whether adverse selection problems wiJl
 prove insurmountable (Michael Rothschild
 and Joseph Stiglitz, 1976)-are still some-
 what open questions, although the size and
 history of large HMOs such as Group Health
 Cooperative of Puget Sound suggest that the
 style is attractive to some consumers.
 In projecting the effect of the growing
 HMO market share on hospital admissions
 and medical expenditure, one must keep in
 mind that the above comparisons have been
 made against the free care plan. Because
 virtually all private fee-for-service health in-
 surance plans include some cost sharing, one
 should compare the reduction in hospital
 admissions at the HMO, some 35 percent,
 with the reduction caused by cost sharing,
 some 15 to 25 percent depending on plan.
 The values presented above, however, do
 represent the ceteris paribus HMO effect; if
 an HMO were to use cost sharing, its ob-
 served rates of use might be even lower.
 Consumers contemplating enrollment in
 an HMO will weigh the cost savings against
 any effect of the reduction in services upon
 health status and consumer satisfaction. Our
 findings on health status of the HMO are
 analogous to those in the free fee-for-service
 system; the mean person in the fee-for-
 service plan appeared to derive few or no
 benefits from the additional hospital services
 (Ware et al., 1986; Elizabeth Sloss et al.
 1987). Those who are both in poor health
 and of low income who were in the HMO
 exhibited a higher rate of bed-days and seri-
 ous symptoms (relative to those in the free
 fee-for-service plan). There is thus some
 suggestive evidence that special programs to
 facilitate access for Medicaid enrollees in
 HMOs may be worthwhile, but we caution
 that this result comes only from one HMO
 (albeit a well-established and well-regarded
 HMO) and that the precision with which we
 could measure results among the poor, sick
 group makes this result less than definitive,
 even in the case of this HMO.
 Those who had self-selected the HMO (the
 Controls) were on average as satisfied with
 their care as those in the fee-for-service sys-
 tem (Allyson Davies et al., 1986). Theory
 would suggest the marginal person would be
 equally satisfied in both systems, and it is
 not surprising that we detected no difference
 for the average person. By contrast, the HMO
 Experimentals were less satisfied overall with
 their care than those in the fee-for-service
 system, although on certain dimensions they
 were as satisfied or even more satisfied.

 a The figures in this column are adjusted for the imbalance of plans across sites as follows: the site-specific
 responses on each plan (simple means by site) are weighted by the fraction of the sample in each site and summed
 across sites. In the case of the 50 percent plan, which has no observations in Seattle, the weights are renormalized
 excluding Seattle.
 b The chi-square statistic with 4 d.f. tests the null hypothesis of no difference among the five plan means. The
 chi-square statistic is a Wald test from the robust estimate of the information matrix (see Brook et al., 1984, for
 further details). It is used in lieu of the usual F-statistic because of the difficulty of computing such a statistic while
 allowing for intertemporal and interfamily correlation.

 20 Keeler and John Rolph (1982) found that cost
 sharing affected the number of episodes of treatment,
 rather than the size of the episode. They used data from
 the first three years of the Dayton site. Kathleen Lohr
 et al. (1986) found a similar result for diagnosis-specific
 episodes.
 21 This is a good example of the difference between
 the response to a marginal price or coinsurance and the
 response to plan.
 22 For example, the ANOVA estimates of the re-
 sponse to cost sharing for total expenses (not adjusted
 for site) show a statistically insignificant reversal be-
 tween the 50 and 25 percent plans. Although such a
 reversal is compatible with theory (due to the .MDE) the
 reversal is almost certainly due to chance. One par-
 ticipant on the 50 percent plan had a very expensive
 hospitalization (total medical expenses of $148,000 in
 one year); that single observation, which was the largest
 observation in the entire sample, adds $106 dollars to
 the 50 percent plan mean (16 percent of that plan's
 mean).
 23 It may seem that this is a trivial result that follows
 from the orthogonality of plan and covariates. Such is
 not the case because of the nonlinear transformations in
 the 4-part model. Using the logarithm of expenditure
 plus $5, for example, as a dependent variable instead of
 the 4-part model would lead to a much larger estimate
 of plan response, one that would be biased upward. (See
 Duan et al., 1983; Manning et al., 1987.)
 24 Recall that the income measure comes from the
 first partial year of enrollment.) The division into thirds
 is site specific (for example, the lowest third is the
 lowest third of each site's income distribution), because
 1) expenses are not corrected for cross-sectional
 differences in prices, and 2) we did not want to con-
 found income and site; the sites were chosen to repre-
 sent a spectrum of medical market characteristics. See
 Manning et al. (1987, Table 1, Appendix D) for the
 ANOVA estimates by plan income group (as well as by
 other subgroups).
 25 Note that this is not a ceteris paribus statement, so
 there is no contradiction with standard theory, which
 would suggest no income effect in the free plan.
 26 See Manning et al. (1987, Appendix B) for data on
 the proportion exceeding the upper limit on out-
 of-pocket expenses.
 27 Some may argue that income is endogenous with
 respect to inpatient expenditure. This may well be true,
 but is not likely to account for our result because only a
 few months of data are " tainted."
 28 Income has a moderately significant (at p <.10)
 and positive partial effect on use in all but the inpatient
 expenditure equation; in the level of outpatient-only
 expenditures, however, the income coefficients are of
 mixed sign. The probabilities with which we can reject
 the null hypothesis that the income coefficients are zero
 are: p <.001 for any use of medical services, p <.10 for
 the probability of any inpatient use given any medical
 use, p <.001 for the (log) level of outpatient-only use,
 and p >.10 for (log) level of medical expenditure if any
 inpatient use. The test statistics include plan income
 interactions and missing value replacement dummy
 variables.
 29 Recall that children are overrepresented in the
 study relative to the population of our sites. Hence, our
 estimates understate (modestly) the population respon-
 siveness In our sites.
 30 $\Chi^2$(4) = 5.19 using ANOVA estimates for the prob-
 ability of any inpatient use, and x2(4) = 5.36 for the
 admission rate. Another possible hypothesis is no dif-
 ferential plan response for children relative to adults.
 We can reject this hypothesis; the test statistics are
 X2(4)= 16.49 for the probability of any inpatient use
 and X2(4) = 14.08 for total admissions. Hence, it ap-
 pears that children and adults respond differently and
 that children do not respond to cost sharing for inpa-
 tient care.
 31 X2(3) = 24.22 for the probability of any inpatient
 use and 16.31 for the admission rate. By contrast, there
 are no significant differences among the family pay
 plans for adults. X2(2) = 1.69 for expenditures, 0.73 for
 total admissions, and 1.39 for the probability of any
 inpatient use, again based on ANOVA (see Manning
 et al., 1987, Table 2, Appendix D for the ANOVA
 estimates).
 32 For example, city sizes in 1970 ranged from 34,000
 (Georgetown County) to 1.2 million (Seattle), waiting
 times for nonemergent care in 1973-74 ranged from 4.1
 days (Seattle) to 25.0 days (Fitchburg), and physicians
 per capita in 1972 ranged from 30 per 100,000 (Fitch-
 burg) to 59 per 100,000 (Seattle).
 33 Length of waiting time to an appointment with a
 primary care physician is associated positively with the
 use of emergency rooms (O'Grady et al.).
 34 A transitory effect was found for dental services;
 see Manning et al. (1985, 1986a) for details.
 35 An HMO is reimbursed a fixed amount per month,
 in return for which it agrees to provide medical care.
 Thus, unlike fee-for-service medicine, the approximate
 marginal revenue from delivering additional services is
 zero. Of course, there are market constraints on the
 HMO's behavior because is competes with fee-for-
 service medicine for patients.
 36The fee-for-service sample in this comparison is
 from Seattle, in order to keep the population sampled
 the same between the two groups.




 IV. Conclusions
 A. On Comparing our Estimates of Demand
 with those in the Literature
 Our results leave little doubt that demand
 elasticities for medical care are nonzero and
 indeed that the response to cost sharing is
 nontrivial. How do our estimates compare
 with those in the nonexperimental literature?
 This question is difficult to answer, be-
 cause most prior empirical work has parame-
 terized cost sharing as a constant coinsurance
 rate (for example, Feldstein, 1971, 1977) or
 has examined particular changes in in-
 surance plans (for example, an imposition of
 a $3 per visit copayment: Scitovsky and
 Snyder; Phelps and Newhouse, 1972; Scitov-
 sky and McCall). By contrast, experimental
 policies were from a two-parameter family
 (coinsurance rate and maximum dollar ex-
 penditure). We make no apologies for this
 intentional noncomparability; a constant
 coinsurance rate, while convenient for ob-
 taining comparative statics results, is not an
 insurance policy that theory suggests would
 be optimal, assuming risk aversion (Arrow,
 1963, 1971, 1973, 1975). Indeed, an optimal
 policy would almost certainly contain a
 stop-loss feature, exactly as the experimental
 plans did.37
 One could, of course, attempt to estimate
 the functional response of demand to varia-
 tion in the two parameters; one can view the
 values presented above as selected points in
 the response surface generated by varying
 coinsurance at given maximum dollar ex-
 penditure levels. In order to compare our
 results with those in the literature, however,
 we must extrapolate to another part of the
 response surface, namely, the response to
 coinsurance variation when there is no maxi-
 mum dollar expenditure. Although any such
 extrapolation is hazardous (and of little
 practical relevance given the considerable
 departure from optimality of such an in-
 surance policy), we have undertaken such an
 extrapolation rather than forego entirely any
 comparison with the literature. Specifically,
 we have used three different methods to
 estimate a price elasticity comparable to the
 estimates in the literature:
 1) One can estimate a pure coinsurance
 elasticity by analyzing variation in the de-
 mand for episodes of care rather than annual
 expenditure per person (Keeler and John
 Rolph, 1982; Keeler et al., 1987). The theory
 of demand suggests that individuals who
 have not yet exceeded the upper limit on
 out-of-pocket expenses, when making a
 marginal medical consumption decision, will
 discount the nominal price by the probabil-
 ity of exceeding the limit (because with that
 probability the true price is zero) (Keeler,
 Newhouse, and Phelps, 1977; Randall Ellis,
 1986).38 We therefore examine demand for
 episodes of treatment by individuals who are
 more than $400 from their limit. This gives
 an approximation of the pure price effect if
 such people treat the true probability of
 exceeding their limit as nearly zero.39 The
 37A stop-loss feature means there is a maximum
 out-of-pocket loss that the insured can sustain. In ad-
 dition to its risk-reduction properties, no worst-case
 payment would have been possible without a stop-loss
 feature, and hence selection effects might have been
 introduced into the experiment.
 38The specific result requires risk neutrality and sep-
 arability of the utility function in health and money, but
 the qualitative results does not.
 39Because there was no appreciable difference be-
 tween demand for outpatient episodes when the MDE
 remaining was between $1 and $400 and when it was
 more than $400, this assumption seems reasonable for

 to ameliorate the consequences of the disease rather than cure. Flare-up of chronic

 estimation method controls for unobserved
 propensities to have episodes, as well as other
 observed covariates by looking at experience
 before and after the MDE is exceeded; see
 Keeler and Rolph for a description of the
 methodology. We have computed arc elastic-
 ities for the 0-25 and 25-95 percent ranges
 of coinsurance; those elasticities are shown
 in Table 8.
 2) A second estimate comes from using
 an indirect utility function and applying it to
 total expenditure in the 25-95 percent range.
 This estimate is very close to the first, -0.18
 (Manning, 1986).
 3) A third estimate comes from a simi-
 lar calculation to those in the literature, that
 is, it uses average coinsurance rates (Table
 9). The usual proof of an upward bias in the
 elasticity estimate from using the average
 coinsurance rate (Newhouse, Phelps, and
 Marquis) does not apply here because of the
 balance across plans. The amount of bias, if
 any, depends on two effects that work in
 opposite directions. For small expenditures
 the experimental plans will exhibit smaller
 expenditure than would a pure coinsurance

 effective coinsurance rate is likely to be
 higher); for large expenditures exceeding the
 MDE the opposite will be true (because the
 marginal coinsurance rate will be zero, not
 positive). Which effect predominates is an
 empirical question the experimental data
 cannot resolve; empirically, this method
 yields values that are somewhat lower but
 still close to those of the other two methods.
 (The lower value suggests the first bias pre-
 dominates.)
 In sum, these three methods suggest that
 price elasticities for a constant coinsurance

 that are consistent with those in the lower

 $10,000 rather than $1000, we might observe fewer
 hospitalizations.

 B. On the Explanation of the Sustained Rise
 in Medical Expenditure
 At first blush, our estimates of demand
 response imply that the spread of health
 insurance can account for only a modest
 portion of the postwar rise in medical ex-
 penditure, contrary to the commonly held
 view described in the introduction. Between
 1950 and 1984, real medical expenditure rose
 by a factor of 7,40 but our estimates of
 insurance elasticity do not begin to imply
 this degree of increase. To demonstrate this
 point, we use the average coinsurance rate.
 Despite its imperfect measure of the generos-
 ity of insurance, it is a gross measure of how
 much insurance changed over the post-1950
 period and therefore indicative of the role
 insurance might have played in this increase.
 Table 10 shows the average coinsurance rate
 by type of service (see Table 9 for compara-
 ble values from the 25, 50, and 95 percent
 plans). Although the figures by service are
 based on an arbitrary accounting conven-
 tion, they suggest that the change in in-
 surance in the postwar period was of roughly
 the same absolute magnitude as the dif-
 ference between the 95 percent coinsurance
 and free care plans.41
 Because the free plan demand was only
 around 1.5 times that of the 95 percent plan,
 it appears that the change in insurance can
 explain only a small part, perhaps a tenth, of
 the factor of 7 change in health expenditure
 in the post-World War II period.
 Nor can changes in real income (around a
 factor of 3 during this period) directly
 account for much of the rise. Income elastic-
 ities estimated from the experimental data
 (the partial response, not the one shown in
 Table 5) are at most 0.2-much too small to
 account for anything like a factor of 7
 change.

 Thus, we still must account for the bulk of
 the expenditure increase. The rather obvious
 "accounting" explanation of the expenditure
 increase is technological change; there are a
 host of new medical products and proce-
 dures today that did not exist in 1950. For
 example, those with kidney failure are now
 treated with renal dialysis or kidney trans-
 plantation; in 1950 these individuals died
 rather quickly. This merely pushes the puzzle
 back one stage, however; what role, if any,
 did insurance (and income growth) play in
 inducing the technological change? Unfor-
 tunately that question cannot be answered
 from experimental data.43
 Thus, if insurance is playing a role in
 inducing a welfare loss, given the rate of
 increase in medical expenditure, the bulk of
 that loss must come from its having induced
 innovation for which unsubsidized con-
 sumers would not be willing to pay.44 Given
 that most countries in the world have also
 experienced a long-term sustained increase
 in expenditure despite widely varying in-
 stitutional arrangements, it is at least argu-
 able that consumers would be willing to pay
 for much of the increase, but there clearly
 40Nominal expenditure data from Katherine Levit
 et al. (1985) deflated by the GNP deflator.
 41 The accounting convention used by the Health
 Care Financing Administration allocates a common de-
 ductible to services in proportion to gross expenditure.
 We have followed the same convention in calculating
 comparable figures from the experimental data.
 42Real GNP increased between 1950 and 1983 by a
 factor of 2.9. Even allowing for the usual downward
 bias from using measured income to estimate income
 elasticities, it is clear that changes in income can only
 explain a modest portion of the expenditure increase.
 43 Because most consumers have been insured for
 inpatient services throughout the relevant time period, it
 is an extremely difficult question to answer from non-
 experimental data. Moreover, one does not observe
 insurance policies that do and do not cover new proce-
 dures, so there is no straightforward test of willingness
 to pay for new technology. Although virtually all poli-
 cies do not cover "experimental" procedures, once
 efficacy and "safety" are demonstrated, insurance plans
 tend to cover all procedures.
 44The willingness-to-pay calculation should include
 any willingness to pay for others' care.

 has been no pure market test (Newhouse,
 1977, 1984).
 C. On the Magnitude of Welfare Loss
 from Health Insurance
 Setting aside the issue of possible welfare
 loss from induced technological change, one
 can estimate the welfare loss in the usual
 static framework. Under a number of strong
 assumptions (including that gross medical
 care prices are competitive and there are no
 externalities), our estimates imply a nontriv-
 ial welfare loss from first-dollar health in-
 surance coverage. An approximation to the
 loss from moving from a universal 95 per-
 cent plan (with a $1000 MDE) to the free
 care plan is $37 to $60 billion, as against an
 expenditure around $200 billion on these
 services in 1984 by the under 65 population.45
 From the $37-60 billion figure must be de-
 ducted some amount for the reduced risk in
 the free plan relative to the 95 percent plan.
 Usual values for risk aversion, however,
 would suggest the deduction is small in the
 presence of a $1000 cap (Feldstein, 1973;
 Keeler, Morrow, and Newhouse, 1977). Al-
 though the $37-60 billion figure is probably
 overstated by ignoring externalities and as-
 suming medical care prices are competitive,
 it ignores any welfare loss from induced
 technological change.46
 D. On the Existing Insurance Coverage
 of Various Medical Services
 One can find several economic reasons for
 the traditionally more generous coverage of
 inpatient services relative to outpatient ser-
 vices (Table 10). Loading charges (as a per-
 45sThe $37 and $60 billion figures are calculated in
 the usual Harberger fashion by taking the $325 per
 capita difference in spending between the 95 percent
 and free plans from Tables 3 and 6 (Year 2 values) and
 adding $19 for mental health services (Wells et al.,
 inflated by the change in the CPI Medical Services
 prices index between 1977 and 1984). We then multiply
 by 207 million, the number of resident civilians under
 65. This yields a figure of $71 billion. One then multi-
 plies by 0.525 or 0.845. Both fractions are larger than
 the usual 0.5 because we do not start at an unsubsidized
 point. Our 95 percent $1000 MDE plan had an average
 coinsurance rate of 0.31. An upper bound on the welfare
 loss comes from assuming that individuals valued the
 last dollar at 0.31. A lower bound on the welfare loss
 comes from assuming that the extra spending is all from
 individuals who valued the last dollar of spending at
 0.95, the nominal coinsurance rate. The 0.525 figure
 equals 1 - .95/2, and the 0.845 figure equals 1 -.31/2.
 The $200 billion figure can be estimated in two ways:
 1) Data from Levit et al. show expenditure on personal
 health care services of $342 billion in 1984. Waldo and
 Lazenby (1984, Table 11) estimate that $120 billion of
 this is for the over 65, leaving $222 billion for the under
 65. Some of this, however, is for noncovered services,
 such as nonprescription drugs, and some other part is
 for ineligible populations, such as the institutionalized.
 Adjusting for these noncomparabilities is necessarily
 somewhat imprecise, but would probably leave a final
 figure around $200 billion. 2) Data from Tables 3 and 6
 (Year 2 values) plus data on outpatient mental health
 spending from Wells et al. inflated to 1984 and scaled
 up by 207 million population imply an expenditure of
 $224 billion on the free care plan in our sites and $178
 billion on the 25 percent coinsurance plans. Adjusting
 for price and usage levels in our sites relative to the
 nation is necessarily imprecise, but these two values
 probably bracket the true national figure.
 46The induced technological change is clearly only a
 welfare loss if patent protection is at the level to induce
 the appropriate investment in new products in an un-
 subsidized market. If there is not enough patent protec-
 tion, there is no necessary welfare loss from insurance's
 inducing a too rapid rate of innovation. There appears
 to be one estimate in the literature of the welfare loss
 from induced change; Feldstein (1973) attempted to
 adjust for the willingness of consumers to pay for
 "higher quality care." There is no empirical way to do
 this, however, so the magnitude of the true welfare loss
 is highly problematic. Feldstein's method, although not
 explicit on the point, in effect ignores true technological
 change. He implicitly assumes that consumers in earlier
 years could have purchased "higher quality" medical
 care, but they chose not to because they faced a higher
 coinsurance rate and/or had lower incomes. (Alterna-
 tively, physician " norms of care" were lower because of
 the higher coinsurance rate and lower income.) As the
 renal dialysis example makes clear, however, consumers
 were simply unable to purchase some medical services
 in earlier years because they did not exist. In many
 cases their subsequent existence depended on funda-
 mental scientific advance such as the discovery of DNA
 and would not have occurred without that advance,
 despite lower coinsurance or higher incomes. Whether
 consumers in the 1950's and early 1960's would have
 purchased such services if they had existed then obvi-
 ously cannot be answered from actual expenditure data.
 Feldstein's method also yields an upper bound for the
 same reason our $60 billion estimate is an upper bound.

 centage of premium) are less, and the risk of
 a large loss is greater. For children, price
 elasticities for inpatient services are not mea-
 surably different from zero, and hence for
 them there is no measurable moral hazard.
 This structure of more extensive insurance
 for inpatient services has been attacked as
 misguided, however (Milton Roemer et al.,
 1975), on the grounds that lack of insurance
 for outpatient services deters ignorant indi-
 viduals from seeking care at a time in their
 illness when they can be treated relatively
 cheaply. Others have also asserted that the
 more generous coverage of inpatient services
 leads physicians to hospitalize patients who
 could be treated on an outpatient basis,
 thereby minimizing private but increasing
 social expenditure.
 Analysis of a natural (not randomized)
 experiment supported the claim that more
 complete coverage of outpatient expenditure
 reduced total expenditure (Roemer et al.;
 L. Jay Helms, Newhouse, and Phelps, 1978),
 but a prior controlled experimental study
 testing this hypothesis rejected it (Charles
 Lewis and Harold Keairnes, 1970; D. B. Hill
 and James Veney, 1980). At issue is whether
 outpatient and inpatient services are sub-
 stitutes or complements.
 Our findings decisively reject the hypothe-
 sis that increased coverage of outpatient
 services, holding constant the coverage of
 inpatient services, will reduce expenditure.
 As Table 3 shows, the mean expenditure on
 the individual deductive plan (free inpatient,
 costly outpatient care) is 20 percent less than
 the mean on the free care plan (free inpa-
 tient, free outpatient care), and the dif-
 ference is statistically significant (p <.001).47
 Disaggregation shows that the outpatient de-
 ductible not only reduces outpatient ex-
 penditure (Table 2) but, if anything, de-
 creases hospital admissions for adults as well
 (Table 5). The (possibly) decreased admis-
 sions for adults suggests that outpatient and
 inpatient services are, if anything, comple-
 ments not substitutes.
 In the interests of brevity we summarize
 four other implications for health insurance
 coverage (these are discussed at greater
 length in Manning et al., 1987):
 There appears to be little justification
 for the common practice of group insurance
 policies' treating emergency room services
 more generously than physician office visits,
 because emergency room services are as re-
 sponsive to plan as physician office visits.48
 There is no support for the so-called
 offset hypothesis, namely that more com-
 plete coverage of psychotherapy services will
 reduce total medical costs (or at least not
 increase them) (W. Follette and Nicholas
 Cummings, 1967, 1968). The experimental
 data, however, are not very precise on this
 question.
 The observed lesser coverage of out-
 patient mental health care relative to all out-
 patient care would be consistent with a great-
 er plan response for mental health care.
 Although the estimated plan response is in
 fact substantially larger for mental health
 care, the difference with all outpatient care is
 statistically insignificant.49
 Well-care services are about as price
 responsive as other medical services. Al-
 though there are other reasons for the com-
 mon practice of not covering well-care
 47In the ANOVA results (Table 2), the estimated
 reduction is 19 percent and the t-statistic is 2.34 (p <.02,
 two-tailed test).
 48 We assume that a presumed lower response to
 insurance is the reason for greater coverage of emer-
 gency room services. The alternative explanations, dif-
 ferential loading charges or asymmetric information, are
 not particularly plausible as explanations of the better
 coverage of emergency room services. Asymmetric in-
 formation (differential knowledge of insurer and in-
 sured) is not very relevant to a single insurance plan
 offered in a group setting unless the service is costly
 enough to motivate an employment change (which might
 apply to psychotherapy or certainly costly dental services
 such as orthodontia). Routine office visits do not match
 this description. Moreover, asymmetric information may
 apply to both office and emergency room services. An
 individual may know that his use of office visits differs
 from average (whereas the insurer does not) but may
 also know that his likelihood of an accident differs from
 average, and the insurer may not.
 49The estimated ratio of the free to 95 plan expendi-
 tures is 233 percent, compared with a 169 percent
 estimate for medical outpatient care (Manning et al.,
 1986b).


 services as generously as other outpatient
 services (primarily there is little or no uncer-
 tainty and loadings are relatively high),
 greater price responsiveness is not a reason.
 E. Was It Worth It?
 One question frequently raised about so-
 cial experimentation is whether its benefits
 are worth its costs (for example, Orley
 Ashenfelter, 1986; Robert Haveman, 1986).
 Because the question concerns the value of
 information, and because the links from this
 type of information to actual behavior are
 generally impossible to establish with any
 rigor, the question admits of no easy answer
 (save for the trivial case in which the experi-
 ment was so poorly designed or conducted
 that it produced no information). In other
 words, any attempt to justify the cost of an
 experiment is necessarily speculative.
 Despite the circumstantial nature of the
 evidence, we believe that the benefits of this
 particular experiment greatly exceeded the
 (current dollar, undiscounted) costs of a lit-
 tle over $80 million ($136 million if put in
 1984 dollars, and brought forward to 1984
 using a 3 percent real discount rate.50 Be-
 tween 1982 and 1984, there was a remark-
 able increase in initial cost sharing in the
 United States, at least for hospital services.
 For example, the number of major compa-
 nies with first-dollar charges for hospital care
 rose from 30 to 63 percent in those two
 years, and the number of such firms with an
 annual deductible of $200 per person or
 more rose from 4 percent to 21 percent (Jeff
 Goldsmith, 1984). Although it is impossible
 to know how much of this change can be
 attributed to the experimental results, the
 initial findings of the experiment were pub-
 lished in December 1981 (Newhouse et al.,
 1981) and December 1983 (Brook et al., 1983)
 and given wide publicity in both the general
 and trade press. In certain instances a direct
 link between changes in cost sharing and the
 experimental results can be made.51
 According to the experimental results, this
 increase in cost sharing should have de-
 creased demand. Hospital days (excluding
 deliveries) among the under 65 decreased by
 19 million days, or 13 percent, discharges
 decreased by 8 percent (USDHHS, Series 13,
 1984; 1986). We estimate the cost saving
 from this reduced use to be around $7 bil-
 lion.52 Physician office and hospital visits
 among the under 65 fell 27 million during
 these two years, but to be conservative we
 have not taken account of this change in
 estimating the cost savings.53
 50We have used the GNP deflators to inflate costs.
 5'For example, the Xerox Corporation in 1983 an-
 nounced an increase in its deductible from $100 per
 person or $200 per family to 1 percent of earnings per
 family. It raised coinsurance on hospital and surgical
 services from 0 to 20 percent. Additionally, it lowered
 its cap on out-of-pocket expenditures (analogous to the
 MDE) from 6 percent of earnings to 4 percent of
 earnings. In a brochure distributed to its employees it
 said: "According to a study by the Rand Corporation,
 when consumers are required to increase their share of
 medical costs, there is a significant decrease in the total
 amount spent for these services. Furthermore, this study
 -and other similar studies-does not indicate that the
 health of the employees was affected adversely by the
 decrease in costs." Despite the large increase in initial
 cost sharing, the average coinsurance rate for hospital
 services nationally only rose from 7.6 to 8.7 percent
 between 1982 and 1984. This modest change in the
 average rate may reflect both the lowering of ceilings on
 out-of-pocket expenditure, as in the Xerox case and the
 highly skewed distribution of hospital expenditure,
 which means most expenditure exceeds the initial cost
 sharing.
 52The average cost per hospital day in 1984 was
 $417. This uses the 1983 $368 figure from the American
 Hospital Association (1984) inflated by 13.3 percent, the
 change in per day inpatient costs from 1983 to 1984
 (American Hospital Association, 1985). Bernard Fried-
 man and Pauly (1981, 1983) have argued that the mar-
 ginal cost/average cost ratio for hospital services is near
 one. Hence, a ceteris paribus estimate of the savings
 from decreased use, assuming a marginal cost/average
 cost ratio of 0.9, is around $7 billion (19 million x 417 x
 0.9). The American Hospital Association cost per day
 figure includes the over 65; however, cost per day is not
 very different for the over 65.
 53 In part, we do not account for such a change
 because the physician visit rate rose in 1985 to its 1982
 value. Thus, the decrease from 1982 to 1984 could have
 been attributable to chance; alternatively the continued
 decrease in hospital care in 1985 (another 7.1 percent
 decrease in patient-days, USDHHS, 1987) may have led
 to a substitution of outpatient use. Data on physician
 visits are from the National Health Interview Survey
 (USDHHS, Series 10, 1985; 1986).

 VOL. 77 NO. 3 MA NNING ETA L:. HEA LTH INSURANCE 273
 If all the changes in patient-days were
 attributable to the increased cost sharing,
 and if all the increase in cost sharing is due
 to the publication of experimental results,
 and if the benefits of the foregone use were
 negligible, as our results suggest, the experi-
 ment paid for itself in about a week
 (.136/7)(52)!54 It is clear that these assump-
 tions overstate the benefits of the experi-
 ment, yet it is equally clear that the assump-
 tions can be greatly relaxed and still yield
 the result that the experiment was worth it.
 Moreover, we have ignored any benefits to
 countries other than the United States, and
 any benefits from the decrease in physician
 visits or changes in dental or mental health
 coverage or emergency room coverage. We
 have also ignored any benefits from the re-
 sults of the HMO portion of the experiment,
 although HMO's market share has been ex-
 panding rapidly from a period just before
 and subsequent to our first article describing
 the HMO results (Manning et al., 1984a).
 Finally, we have ignored the value of the
 public use files to future research efforts.55
 Implicit in our conclusions is the assump-
 tion that one could not reduce uncertainty
 with nonexperimental data to the satisfac-
 tion of those making decisions about cost
 sharing. We believe this is likely to be true,
 because of the wide range of nonexperimen-
 tal estimates of insurance elasticity cited in
 the introduction, the difficulty of inferring
 health status effects from nonexperimental
 data, and the temporal proximity of the
 changes in cost sharing to the publication of
 the experimental results (many of the nonex-
 perimental results had been in the literature
 for a decade, during which time cost sharing
 had, if anything, decreased). Thus, we think
 it highly plausible that the benefits of this
 endeavor were indeed worth its costs.
 F. On Experimentation in Economics
 Econometric and economics texts often
 have a statement near the beginning that
 experimentation is not nearly as possible in
 economics as it is in the physical sciences.
 Perhaps the degree of difference is not as
 great as many think. Well-designed and ex-
 ecuted field and laboratory experiments are
 feasible and can add substantially to the
 body of knowledge (Walter Heller, 1975;
 Charles Plott, 1982).56 We hope this example
 will encourage others to ask whether an ex-
 periment is practical or feasible when ap-
 proaching empirical questions.
 54 The negligible benefits assumption relies on the
 observation that cost sharing for hospital services was
 near zero in 1982 and that there were no measurable
 health benefits outside the dental area for the middle-
 class employees who would have been the dominant
 group for whom the cost sharing changed.
 55The public use files can be ordered from Publica-
 tions Department, The Rand Corporation, 1700 Main
 Street, Santa Monica, CA 90406-2138.

 Hausman and David Wise (1985) and Robert Ferber
