   abstract = {Standard discrete choice models used to evaluate mergers assume that dierent product varieties are substitutes. However, legal defences in some recent high-prole mergers rested on demand com-plementarity (e.g., GE/Honeywell). Since complements tend to be priced lower by a monopolist than by a duopoly, standard models will overstate consumer harm in these mergers. We use consumer level data from Nielsen to look at two products with natural demand complementarities and a history of regulatory activity-potato chips and carbonated soda pop. We estimate a discrete choice model that allows for demand complementarity across pop and chips, using a novel estimator that leverages information on bundle specic purchases from consumer micro data, as well as aggregate scanner data. We then simulate a number of antitrust counterfactuals in the chips and carbonated soda market. Once demand complementarity is taken into account, a merger between the chips and soda producer PepsiCo/Frito-Lay and the soda producer Dr. Pepper will reduce chip prices. Soda prices will either increase or fall, depending on the market. By contrast, the standard discrete choice model predicts that soda prices would always increase following the merger. An additional counterfactual breaking up the PepsiCo/Frito-Lay conglomerate suggests that both chip and soda prices will increase as a result. * We would like to thank Victor Aguirregabiria, Avi Goldfarb, Heski Bar-Isaac and Michelle Sovinsky for their helpful comments on this project.

   abstract = {Background :Whether inpatient services can be successfully substituted by office-based services has been debated for many decades, but the evidence is still inconclusive. This study aims to investigate the effect of office-based care on use and the expenditure for other healthcare services in patients with type II diabetes (T2D). Methods: A generalized propensity score matching approach was used on pooled Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) data for 2000-2012 to explore a dose-response effect. Patients were matched by using a comprehensive set of variables selected following a standard model on access to care. Findings: Office-based care (up to 5 visits/year) acts as a substitute for other healthcare services and is associated with lower use and expenditure for inpatient, outpatient and emergency care. After five visits, office-based care becomes a complement to other services and is associated with increases in expenditure for T2D. Above 20 to 26 visits per year, depending on the healthcare service under consideration, the marginal effect of an additional office-based visit becomes non-statistically significant. Conclusions: Office-based visits appear to be an effective instrument to reduce use of inpatient care and other services, including outpatient and emergency-care, in patients with T2D without any increase in total healthcare expenditure.},

   abstract = {Background: Assessing the impact of cost sharing on healthcare utilization is a critical issue in health economics and health policy. It may affect the utilization of different services, but is yet to be well understood. Objective: This paper investigates the effects of reducing cost sharing for outpatient services on hospital admissions by exploring a subsidy policy for children’s outpatient services in Japan. Methods: Data were extracted from the Japanese Diagnosis Procedure Combination database for 2012 and 2013. A total of 366,566 inpatients from 1390 municipalities were identified. The impact of expanding outpatient care subsidy on the volume of inpatient care for 1390 Japanese municipalities was investigated using the generalized linear model with fixed effects. Results: A decrease in cost sharing for outpatient care has no significant effect on overall hospital admissions, although this effect varies by region. The subsidy reduces the number of overall admissions in low-income areas, but increases it in high-income areas. In addition, the results for admissions by type show that admissions for diagnosis increase particularly in high-income areas, but emergency admissions and ambulatory-care-sensitive-condition admissions decrease in low-income areas. Conclusions: These results suggest that outpatient and inpatient services are substitutes in low-income areas but complements in high-income ones. Although the subsidy for children’s healthcare would increase medical costs, it would not improve the health status in high-income areas. Nevertheless, it could lead to some health improvements in low-income areas and, to some extent, offset costs by reducing admissions in these regions.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND:A number of states have implemented Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) teams statewide. The extent to which team-based care in ACT programs substitutes or complements primary care and other types of health services is relatively unknown outside of clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To analyze whether investments in ACT yield savings in primary care and other outpatient health services. DESIGN: Patterns of medical and mental health service use and costs were examined using Medicaid claims files from 2000 to 2002 in North Carolina. Two-part models and negative binomial models compared individuals on ACT (n = 1,065 distinct individuals) with two control groups of Medicaid enrollees with severe mental illness not receiving ACT services (n = 1,426 and n = 41,717 distinct individuals). RESULTS: We found no evidence that ACT affected utilization of other outpatient health services or primary care; however, ACT was associated with a decrease in other outpatient health expenditures (excluding ACT) through a reduction in the intensity with which these services were used. Consistent with prior literature, ACT also decreased the likelihood of emergency room visits and inpatient psychiatric stays. CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing emphasis and efforts toward integrating physical health and behavioral health care, it is likely that ACT will continue to be challenged to meet the physical health needs of its consumers. To improve primary care receipt, this may mean a departure from traditional staffing patterns (e.g., the addition of a primary care doctor and nurse) and expansion of the direct services ACT provides to incorporate physical health treatments. © The Author(s) 2013.},

   abstract = {Background & objectives: The burden of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in Nepal, as in other developing countries, falls disproportionately upon the rural poor. Promoting use of outpatient (OP) care, an alternative to inpatient (IP) care has long been advocated to reduce cost of care in both the demand and supply sides as substitution of relatively cheaper resources for expensive resources in the production of health care services. The paper aims to assess the intensity of demand for VL care and explore possibilities of the substitutability or complementation patterns between OP care and IP care of VL. Methods: In order to explore the possibility of substitute (or complement) of OP care for IP care, we exploited the ordinary least squared method by utilizing recently collected data from the VL endemic districts of Nepal. The sample size represented >25% of the population of VL of the country. The paper measured the sensitivity analysis of demand for OP and IP cares using appropriate demand models. Results: The coefficients of demand models gave negative relationship between quantity demanded for health care and their prices. It is plausible that OP price has strong power than IP price to determine the respective quantity demanded for health care. As expected, income has negative sign, but not significant that means income has no effect on determining the demand for health care because VL is a disease of poor. Conclusion: Recently, improvements in treatment and diagnostic techniques suggest a substitute of OP care for IP care; however, the OP and IP cares are complements due to behavioural factors.},

   abstract = {Background: Only limited empirical studies reported own-price elasticity of demand for health care in rural China. Neither research on income elasticity of demand for health care nor cross-price elasticity of demand for inpatient versus outpatient services in rural China has been reported. However, elasticity of demand is informative to evaluate current policy and to guide further policy making. Objectives: Our study contributes to the literature by estimating three elasticities (i.e., own-price elasticity, cross-price elasticity, and income elasticity of demand for health care based on nationwide-representative data. We aim to answer three empirical questions with regard to health expenditure in rural China: (1) Which service is more sensitive to price change, outpatient or inpatient service? (2) Is outpatient service a substitute or complement to inpatient service? and (3) Does demand for inpatient services grow faster than demand for outpatient services with income growth? Methods: Based on data from a National Health Services Survey, a Probit regression model with probability of outpatient visit and probability of inpatient visit as dependent variables and a zero-truncated negative binomial regression model with outpatient visits as dependent variable were constructed to isolate the effects of price and income on demand for health care. Both pooled and separated regressions for 2003 and 2008 were conducted with tests of robustness. Results: Own-price elasticities of demand for first outpatient visit, outpatient visits among users and first inpatient visit are -0.519 [95% confidence interval (-0.703, -0.336)], -0.547 [95% confidence interval (-0.747, -0.347)] and -0.372 [95% confidence interval (-0.517, -0.226)], respectively. Cross-price elasticities of demand for first outpatient visit, outpatient visits among users and first inpatient visit are 0.073 [95% confidence interval (-0.176, 0.322)], 0.308 [95% confidence interval (0.087, 0.528)], and 0.059 [95% confidence interval (-0.085, 0.204)], respectively. Income elasticities of demand for first outpatient visit, outpatient visits among users and first inpatient visit are 0.098 [95% confidence interval (0.018, 0.178)], 0.136 [95% confidence interval (0.028, 0.245)] and 0.521 [95% confidence interval (0.438, 0.605)], respectively. The aforementioned results are in 2008, which hold similar pattern as results in 2003 as well as results from pooled data of two periods. Conclusion: First, no significant difference is detected between sensitivity of outpatient services and sensitivity of inpatient services, responding to own-price change. Second, inpatient services are substitutes to outpatient services. Third, the growth of inpatient services is faster than the growth in outpatient services in response to income growth. The major findings from this paper suggest refining insurance policy in rural China. First, from a cost-effectiveness perspective, changing outpatient price is at least as effective as changing inpatient price to adjust demand of health care. Second, the current national guideline of healthcare reform to increase the reimbursement rate for inpatient services will crowd out outpatient services; however, we have no evidence about the change in demand for inpatient service if insurance covers outpatient services. Third, a referral system and gate-keeping system should be established to guide rural patients to utilize outpatient service. © 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

   abstract = {Background: In recent years, lower cost non-physician providers have been increasingly used to deliver outpatient mental health services. Methods: We compared 1997 and 2004 data on outpatient services provided by the Veterans Health Administration to examine trends in outpatient provider mix and to evaluate the association of outpatient provider mix with average per capita outpatient mental health costs. Results: We found a small decline in the proportion of outpatient mental health services provided by psychiatrists and an increase in the proportion of such services provided by nurses. However, greater use of non-physician providers, at the facility level, was associated with greater, rather than lower per capita outpatient costs and there was no significant change over time. Conclusion: While an increasing proportion of outpatient mental health visits were with non-psychiatrists, there was not an associated decline in per capita mental health costs. Increasing VA workloads over the past decade have forced increases in psychiatrist panel size, substantially increasing physician efficiency. Additional non-physician staff have supported the development of psychosocial rehabilitation and crisis intervention capacities needed to cope with a 63% decline in inpatient beds and thus have most likely been complements of, rather than substitutes for, psychiatrists.

   abstract = {Objective. To determine whether strategies designed to increase members' use of primary care services result in decreases (substitution) or increases (complementation) in the use and cost of other types of health services. Study Setting. Encounter and cost data were extracted from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) administrative data sources for the period 1995-1999. This time-frame captures the VA's natural experiment of increasing geographic access to primary care by establishing new satellite primary care clinics, known as Community-Based Outpatient Clinics (CBOCs). Study Design. We exploited this natural experiment to estimate the substitutability of primary care for other health services and its impact on cost. Hypotheses were tested using ordinary least squares (OLS) regression, which was potentially subject to endogeneity bias. Endogeneity bias was assessed using a Hausman test. Endogeneity bias was accounted for by using instrumental variables analysis, which capitalized on the establishment of CBOCs to provide an exogenous identifier (change in travel distance to primary care). Data Collection. Demographic, encounter, and cost data were collected for all veterans using VA health services who resided in the catchment areas of new CBOCs and for a matched group of veterans residing outside CBOC catchment areas. Principal Findings. Change in distance to primary care was a significant and substantial predictor of change in primary care visits. OLS analyses indicated that an increase in primary care service use was associated with increases in the use of all specialty outpatient services and inpatient services, as well as increases in inpatient and outpatient costs. Hausman tests confirmed that OLS results for specialty mental health encounters and mental health admissions were unbiased, but that results for specialty medical encounters, physical health admissions, and outpatient costs were biased. Instrumental variables analyses indicated that an increase in primary care encounters was associated with a decrease in specialty medical encounters and was not associated with an increase in physical health admissions, or outpatient costs. Conclusions. Results provide evidence that health systems can implement strategies to encourage their members to use more primary care services without driving up physical health costs. © Health Research and Educational Trust.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES This study examined the effect of private health insurance on the use of medical, surgical, psychiatric, and addiction services for patients eligible for publicly supported care. METHODS The authors assembled administrative databases describing 350,000 noninstitutionalized veterans who had been discharged from a Veterans Affairs (VA) inpatient medicine or surgery bed section during a 1-year period. Patient use of care was followed for 1 year after the index discharge. Patient insurance information came from Medical Care Cost Recovery Billing and Collection files obtained separately from each of 162 VA Medical Centers. Distances between VA and non-VA sources of care were estimated from the Health Care Financing Administration's Hospital Distance File. RESULTS Insured patients were less likely to seek surgical care but were 12 times (65 years of age and older) and 73 times (63 years of age and younger) more likely to initiate outpatient medical visits than were their counterparts, adjusted for patient demographic, diagnostic, and index facility characteristics. Patients who had private health insurance also were 3.4 (> or = 65) and 2.6 (< or = 64) times less likely to use VA surgical care in response to changes in available surgical staff-to-patient ratios than were their uninsured counterparts. CONCLUSIONS Private health insurance may substitute (reduce) or complement (increase) the continued use of publicly supported health care services, depending on patient age, care setting, and service type.},

This closer examination of outcomes brings to light the interactions between redistributive programs and services and the role of substitutes and complements in state-level policy analysis. (A substitute is a benefit or service that can be used instead of another to produce a similar outcome; a complement is a benefit or service that is likely to result in the use of another benefit or service). Support is found for the inclusion of these theoretical constructs in policy analysis. Regarding Medicaid, the author concludes that physician, outpatient, and clinical services all complement hospital services; that physician and outpatient services substitute for one another; that state AFDC and SSI policy decisions have a greater impact on utilization than Medicaid-specific eligibility and service decisions do; and that the factors driving utilization (supply, demand, etc.) vary dramatically across acute care settings. The implications for Medicaid policymaking are also discussed.},

The hospital use of CHC users (age- and sex-adjusted admissions, days, and length of stay) was compared with that of nonusers from the same communities in 1980. Statistically lower rates of hospital admissions and days were observed for all CHC patients and for selected groups based on their age, sex, and insurance status (specifically Medicaid or Medicare). Hospital use of CHC community populations was then compared with that of 24 comparison communities without access to CHCs, using multiple linear regression in a pre/post design. The model tested, which included rates of health center use, insurance penetration, poverty, and hospital availability, among other factors, did not detect any differences in hospital use between CHC community and comparison populations. These results and additional data presented on selected hospital diagnoses and insurance coverage suggest that treatment, and hospitalization incentives, of CHC providers may reduce hospitalization.
