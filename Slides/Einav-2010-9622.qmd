## Overview

- **Objective:** Quantify the welfare loss in insurance markets with (adverse or advantageous) selection due to inefficient pricing.
- **Key Findings:** 
  - Evidence of adverse selection in employer-provided health insurance.
  - Quantitative welfare loss of inefficient pricing is small.
- **Methodology:** 
  - Use of price variation to identify and estimate demand and insurers' costs.

## Overview

- **Contribution:** 
  - Show how to use standard consumer and producer theory to empirically estimate welfare losses in markets with selection.
  - According to authors: Fewer assumptions about consumers' preferences, straightforward implementation, and general

## Introduction

- Complementary approach to empirical welfare analysis requiring fewer assumptions
  - Revealed preference, demand and cost curves are sufficient statistics for welfare analysis
- Fewer assumptions at the cost of limiting welfare analysis to only observed (existing) contracts
  - Distortion of offered contracts set not allowed

## Introduction

- In Graphical analysis, the authors show that the slope of the cost curve provides a direct test of selection
  - Constant (horizontal) marginal cost curve, no selection; negative, adverse selection; positive, advantageous selection

## Introduction

- Employer-provided health insurance
- Individual-level data from Alcoa, Inc., large multinational aluminum producer
  - Health insurance options, choices, and medical insurance claims
  - Price variation used in identification arises due to Alcoa's organizational structure, (orthogonal to employee characteristics)
- Authors detect adverse selection and estimate the welfare loss to be small (<$10 per employee, 3% of efficient total surplus)

## Theoretical Framework

- Individuals choose from two insurance contracts, $H$ high (insurance) and $L$ low coverage (no insurance).
- Characteristics of insurance contracts are taken as given, but price is determined endogenously
- Population defined by a distribution $G(\zeta)$, $\zeta$ vector of consumer characteristics
- Relative price of contract H by $p$

## Theoretical Framework

- $v^H(\zeta_i,p)$ and $v^L(\zeta_i)$ denote the consumer $i's$ utility from buying contracts $H$ and $L$, respectively
  - $v^H(\zeta_i,p)$ strictly decreasing in $p$ and $v^H(\zeta_i,p=0)>v^H(\zeta_i)$
- Expected monetary cost of providing insurance to individual $i$, $c(\zeta_i)$

## Demand for Insurance

- Each individual makes a discrete choice, buying insurance or not
  - [Demand is only a function of price (abstracting from coverage level)]{.small}
  - [Firms cannot offer different prices to different individuals [(empirical application: exogenous price variation)]{.small}]{.small}
  - [Individuals buy at the lowest price available, demand can be sufficiently characterized as a function of the lowest price $p$]{.small}
- Individual $i$ buys insurance if and only if $v^H(\zeta_i,p)>v^L(\zeta_i)$
- Willingness to pay $\pi(\zeta_i)\equiv\max\{p:v^H(\zeta_i,p)>v^L(\zeta_i) \}$

## Demand for Insurance

- Aggregate demand is
  $$
    D(p)=\int \mathbb{1}(\pi(\zeta)\ge p)dG(\zeta)=\text{Pr}(\pi(\zeta)\ge p)
  $$ {#eq-demand}

## Supply

- $N\ge2$ insurance providers set prices à la Bertrand (perfect competition) [Under perfect competition, any inefficiency is attributed to selection]{.small}
- The cost of providing contract $H$ to individual $i$ are the insurable cost $c(\zeta_i)$ [No other admin or production costs]{.small}

## Supply

- The average (expected) cost curve
  $$
    \text{AC}(p)=\frac{1}{D(p)}\int c(\zeta)\mathbb{1}(\pi(\zeta)\ge p)dG(\zeta)=\mathbb{E}[c(\zeta)| \pi(\zeta)\ge p]
  $$ {#eq-ac}

- The marginal (expected) cost curve is
  $$
    \text{MC}(p)=\mathbb{E}[c(\zeta)|\pi(\zeta)=p]
  $$ {#eq-mc}

## Equilibrium

- It is profitable to provide insurance
- Single crossing between MC$(p)$ and the demand curve
- The equilibrium
  $$
    p^*=min\{p:p=\text{AC}(p)\}
  $$

## Measuring Welfare

- Authors measure consumer surplus by the certainty equivalent
  - The certainty equivalent of an uncertain outcome is the amount that would make an individual indifferent between obtaining this amount for sure and obtaining the uncertain outcome
- Income effects are ignored (equivalent to assuming CARA utility function)
- $e^H(\zeta_i)$ and $e^L(\zeta_i)$ denote the certainty equivalent for consumer $i$ of an allocation of contract $H$ and $L$, respectively
- The willingness to pay $\pi(\zeta_i)=e^H(\zeta_i)-e^L(\zeta_i)>0$

## Measuring Welfare

- Consumer welfare
  $$
    \text{CS}=\int[(e^H(\zeta)-p)\mathbb{1}(\pi(\zeta)\ge p)+e^L(\zeta)\mathbb{1}(\pi(\zeta)<p)]dG(\zeta)
  $$
- Producer welfare
  $$
    \text{PS}=\int(p-c(\zeta))\mathbb{1}(\pi(\zeta)\ge p)dG(\zeta)
  $$

## Measuring Welfare

- Total welfare
  $$
    \text{TS=CS+PS}=\int[(e^H(\zeta)-c(\zeta))\mathbb{1}(\pi(\zeta)\ge p)+e^L(\zeta)\mathbb{1}(\pi(\zeta)<p)]dG(\zeta)
  $$

## Graphical Representation


- Adverse selection: Individuals with the highest willingness to pay for insurance are those who, on average, have the highest expected costs
  - Downward-sloping MC: MC is decreasing in quantity
  - [As the price falls, the marginal individuals who select contract $H$ have a lower expected cost than inframarginal individuals, leading to lower average costs]{.small}
  - Uniform pricing [(firms cannot discriminate individuals based on their privately known marginal costs)]{.small} implies average-cost pricing in equilibrium
  - AC > MC leads to underinsurance in adverse selection

## 

![Adverse selection implies the marginal cost curve is downward-
sloping, people with the highest willingness to pay also have the highest expected cost to the insurer. Competitive equilibrium is given by point C (demand =average cost), whereas the efﬁcient allocation is E (demand = marginal cost). The (shaded) triangle CDE represents the welfare cost from underinsurance.](figures/adverse-selection.png){fig-align="center"}

## Advantageous Selection

- Individuals with the highest willingness to pay insurance have, on average, the lowest expected costs. 
  - MC and AC curves are upward-sloping
  - Leading to over-insurance
  - Intuitively, insurance providers have an additional incentive to reduce price, as the inframarginal customers whom they acquire as a result are relatively good risks.

## Sufficient Statistics

- Graphical analyses illustrate that the demand and cost curves are sufficient statistics for welfare analysis of equilibrium and nonequilibrium pricing of existing contracts
  - Different underlying primitives have the same welfare implications if they generate the same demand and cost curves
  - Primitives: preferences and private information summarized by $\zeta$

## Sufficient Statistics

- This suggests an empirical approach to remain agnostic about the underlying primitives: estimating demand and cost curves
  - Requiring: Revealed preferences choices from individuals can be used for welfare analysis
  - Limits counterfactuals to only price variation for the set of observed insurance contracts
  - Examples: Mandatory insurance coverage, taxes and subsidies for insurance, regulation eliminating an existing contract, etc.

## Estimation

- The framework requires data allowing the estimation of the demand curve $D(p)$ and the average cost curve $AC(p)$
- Marginal cost curve can be derived by
  $$
  \begin{aligned}
    MC(p)
    &=\frac{\partial TC(p)}{\partial D(p)}=\frac{\partial(AC(p)\cdot D(p))}{\partial D(p)}\\
    &=\left(\frac{\partial D(p)}{\partial p}\right)^{-1}\frac{\partial(AC(p)\cdot D(p))}{\partial p}
  \end{aligned}
  $$

## Identification

- To identify demand, price variation exogenous to unobservable demand characteristics is needed
- Authors claim they do not need an additional source of variation to estimate the average cost curve AC(p) because
  - Expected costs are likely to affect demand, any exogenous price variation to demand is also exogenous to insurable cost

## Employer-Provided Health Insurance {.smaller}

- Individual level data from 2004 on the U.S.-based employees and their dependants at Alcoa, Inc.
- In 2004, Alcoa had ~45,000 employees in the U.S. working in 300 different job sites in 39 different states.
- Alcoa introduced a new set of health insurance options for virtually all its salaried employees and about half of its hourly employees
- Data includes the menu of health options available, employee premium of each option, employee's coverage choice, and detailed claim-level information on all the employee medical expenditures including covered dependants
- Data also includes demographic information, such as age, race, gender, annual earnings, and job tenure

## Subsample

- Analysis restricted to a subsample of employees for whom the **pricing variation is cleaner**
- 3,779 salaried employees who chose one of the two modal health insurance choices: a higher and a lower level of PPO coverage

## Price Variation

- In 2004, as part of the new benefit design, company headquarters offered a set of seven different possible pricing menus for employee benefits.
- The coverage options are the same across all the menus, but the prices (employee premiums) associated with these options vary
  - The object of interest is the incremental (annual) premium for contract $H$ relative to $L$, $p=p_H-p_L$
  - There were six different values of $p$ in 2004, from \$384 to \$659

## Price Variation by Business Unit

- The president of each business unit determined the price menu for the employees of their respective business unit
- Alcoa had forty business units. Each unit has essentially complete independence to run its business
- Business units are typically organized by functionality and are independent of geography (there are often multiple business units in the same state)

## Price Variation by Business Unit

- The median business unit has about 500 employees
- The business unit president may choose different price menus for employees within his unit based on their location and employment type (salaried/hourly, hourly by union)
- As a result, employees doing the same job in the same location may face different prices for their health insurance benefits due to their business affiliations

## Price Variation

![](figures/table-1-p-var.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Price Variation Analysis

- Authors claim that they could not reject the null that all the coefficients are jointly uncorrelated; F-test p-value=0.14
- Business unit presidents were opposed to charging employees much for health insurance coverage 
- After 2004, Alcoa no longer gave business unit presidents a choice on benefit prices and adopted a uniform pricing structure
- A similar analysis for hourly workers reveals statistically significant differences across employees who face different prices

## Price Variation Analysis

![](figures/table-2-p-var.png){fig-align="center" width="70%"}

## Empirical Strategy

- $p_i=p_i^H-p_i^L$, relative price employee $i$ faces
- $D_i$ is equal to 1 if employee $i$ chooses contract $H$, and O if $L$
- $m_i$ total medical expenditure of employee $i$ and covered family members
- $c_i=c(m_i;H)-c(m_i;L)$ is the incremental cost to the insurer from providing contract H relative to L, holding $m_i$ fixed.
  - $c(m_i;H)$ and $c(m_i;L)$ denote the cost to the insurance company from medical expenditures under H and L
  - $c(m_i;H)$ is observed; $c(m_I;L)$ is computed counterfactually using the claims data and the plan L rules

## Estimating Equations

$$
\begin{aligned}
  D_i&=\alpha+\beta p_i + \epsilon_i \\
  c_i&=\gamma+\delta p_i + u_i
\end{aligned}
$$ {#eq-estimating}

## MC and Equilibrium P and Q

Having estimated the demand and AC, we can find MC, 

$$
MC(p)=\frac{\alpha\delta}{\beta}+\gamma+2\delta p
$$

With MC, we can find the equilibrium and the efficient price and quantity; Equilibrium AC(p)=p, Efficient MC(p)=p
$$
\begin{aligned}
  P_{eq} &=\gamma/(1-\delta)\\
  Q_{eq} &=\alpha + \beta(\gamma/(1-\delta))\\
\end{aligned}
$$

## Efficient P and Q

Efficient MC(p)=p
$$
\begin{aligned}
  P_{eff} &=\frac{1}{(1-2\delta)(\frac{\alpha\delta}{\beta}+\gamma)}\\
  Q_{eff} &=\alpha+\frac{1}{(1-2\delta)(\alpha\delta+\beta\gamma)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Welfare Loss
$$
  \Delta_{CDE}=-\frac{\delta^2}{2(1-2\delta)\beta}\left(\alpha+\frac{\beta\gamma}{1-\delta}\right)^2
$$

## Results

![](figures/fig-5-results.png){fig-align="center"}

## Results

- Downward sloping demand $\beta=-0.0007$
  - a \$100 increase in price reduces the probablity of getting $H$ by 11\%
- Cost curve slope indicates the existence of adverse selection $\delta=0.155$
  - The average cost of individuals who purchased contract $H$ is higher when the price is higher
  - The average cost curve is therefore downward-sloping in quantity

## Results

- Welfare cost of adverse selection \$9.55 per employee per year
- Adverse selection increases price by almost \$200 and reduces the share of H by 14 p.p.
